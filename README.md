I am going to share the recipe of very delicious CHOCOLATE DONUTS step by step. It is typically prepared with all purpose flour or maida dough which is fermented using yeast or baking powder. The fermented dough is later shaped to ring shape with a hole in a centre and later deep fried till golden brown. Further it is glazed with cream, jam, chocolate syrup, sugar icing or even with fruit syrup.
